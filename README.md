# conwaysjs
An implementation of the Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript

## How to Use

Simply clone the directory into any folder you like and double click the index.html so that the game starts

## Additional Information

I haven't put much thought into ease of configuration yet into this cause I just wrote it very fast, make sure to have a look inside to make any required changes,
there might be some trailing code cause I was lazy.
